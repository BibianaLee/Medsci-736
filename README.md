# The statistical Analysis of the Inner Ear
This project used Python and python data analysis library [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)in order to parse, structure and analyse the large MRI datasets obtained during the project. 
Visualisation of the project data was achieved using a plotting library called [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) and analysis was completed using the [SciPy library](https://www.scipy.org/)

## Project Description

This study looks to quantify spatial and temporal inflammation-induced changes in the capsular permeability and macrophage infiltration in guinea-pig cochlea using MRI. Modelling of such exchanges in blood and different inner ear (IE) compartments require the analysis of a substantial amount of data. 

This data has been extracted from a set of MRI which measures the propagation of a contrast agent injected into the IE. This project aims to investigate the parsing of this data and statistical analysis of these results. 

This project could provide reference data that can in future be used to quantitatively assess the treatment of ear disease in animal models and establish a platform from which such techniques can be transferred into clinical practice. 


## Prerequisities

1. **Python**
   - Successful running of this programme will require Python 2.7.12
   - You can download Python 2.7.12 following [This link ](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2712/)  
   - Alternatively, you may alter the script to fit your version of Python

2. **Operating System**
  - Ubuntu 16.04 LTS 


##Data File Requirements

 - Data Files must be text files (.txt)
 - Files should be labeled like this: **(no.of images)D(no.days after treatment or non-treatment)**
 - So the name should contain **a number** followed by a **D** then another **number**
 - For example: a file labeled **13D4** is an animal that has been imaged 13 times, 4 days after treatment 
 
 ###Labels 
 - The data file must contain the following labels. **This is a must**
 - The Ktrans and Diffusion coefficient labels must be followed by four numbers 
 - ID1 can be either 294 (Right ear) or 295 (Left ear) 
 - ID2 is the height of the cochlear anatomy and ranges from 0 - 7 
 
      ```

##Running the programme using the test data
###Loading project_IE.py
1) Download the test_Project_IE folder and transfer the project_IE.py
2) Open a command line terminal in the folder containing project_IE.py
 
3) Type in python project_IE.py in the command window 
4) Once this is complete you should be greeted with the first menu 

   ```
   Welcome to Project IE
   your options are:

   1) One file
   2) Quit

   Choose your option:
   ```
   **If you would like to exit the programme you can type `2` otherwise keep reading the instructions**
   
###Loading dummy data 
1. Type `1`
 - If you enter an invalid number a message will appear saying 
   
   `The number you have entered is invalid please choose either option 1 or 2 `
   
2. Type in `10D4`
   - Your DataFrames should print now this should be followed by a message that reads: 

   ```
   Your graph has been plotted and saved
   
   You may choose another option now
   
   ```
3. The secondary  menu should greet you now
   ```
   What would you like to do now?

   ```
   ___________________________________________________

   One-way ANOVA P = 0.562677075784



   The differences between the means are not statistically significant 


   Your analysis is complete.

##Limitations 
   - The analysis and graph produced are for demonstrative purposes only. **This is a prototype**.
   - This prototype only checks for `#` and `empty spaces` as the MRI data text files not contain any other intrusive characters. Other characters such as a `@` may not detected by the software while parsing. It is therefore advised that the user **manually checks the file first if they are using their own data**.
   - The graph output is labeled "Your Graph" and will need to be manually re-named 
   - Once a file is in the programme it will be parsed and analyzed and it must run its course before you can quit and load another separate file 
   - This prototype is specifically for MRI text datafiles produced by an ongoing study so the labels must be present in the raw data or else the code will not work
